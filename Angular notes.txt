Angular js:-

AngularJS extends HTML with new attributes.
AngularJS is perfect for Single Page Applications (SPAs).
and can be added to a web page with a script tag
The prefix ng stands for "A ng ular;"

AngularJS Extends HTML
AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.

1. ng-app  defines who is owner of AngularJS application.
 The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.
 <div ng-app="">
 The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.
 means iss container (div ) k ander angular use kiya gaya hai

Q1. can we have multiple ng-app in html application ?
ans- yes we have to mannualy bootstrap them
   To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using angular.bootstrap()
   JS:-
   angular.bootstrap(document.getElementById("module2"), ['mySecondModule']);


2.  ng-model($scope) will bind html view to application data 
e.g form value which has to be entered(HTML controls (input, select, textarea) value can be
 used by using ng-bind)	
 The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
  -The ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.

3. The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.
<p ng-bind="name"></p> this will display ng-model data

You can use data-ng-, instead of ng-, if you want to make your page HTML valid.

AngularJS Expressions
AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}
AngularJS will "output" data exactly where the expression is written
<p>My first expression: {{ 5 + 5 }}</p> = 10

<p>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p>
<p>{{name}}</p>

AngularJS Applications:---	`
AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.
AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.

AngularJS Modules:-
Application is divided into modules and each module contains different logic
The module is a container for the application controllers(logic)

Angular module is created by angular.module(,);
ex-
<div ng-app="myApp">...</div>

<script>

var app = angular.module("myApp", []); 

</script>

there is element of html, inside that element we can add element controller, filter , directives

Adding a controller :-
<div ng-app="timesheet" ng-controller="tsCnt" >  
{{val1 + " " +val2}}
 </div>

<script>
var abc = angular.module("timesheet",[]);
abc.controller("tsCnt",function($scope){
$scope.val1="first value";
$scope.val2="Secound value";
});
</script>



Adding a directive:-
use- AngularJS allows you to create custom directives with which it becomes easier to encapsulate and simplify 
DOM(Document Object Model) manipulation

<div ng-app="app" my-directive>
</div>

<script>

var abc= angular.module("app",[]);
abc.directive("my-directive",function(){
return {
template: "this is created in directive controller"
};
});

</script>

Modules and Controller 

As above mention
module = define the angular app 
controller = controlles angular app
both are .js file

we should write seprate logic for module and controller in html file through script tag

<body>

<script src="mymodl.js" />  application module
<script src="myCntrl.js" /> controller module 

</body>

myApp.js
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

myCtrl.js
app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) {
    $scope.firstName = "John";
    $scope.lastName= "Doe";
});


module defination me generally angular.module("application name",[]); rehta hai
[] angular bracet is for dependent module 
if they are not present means they are retriving data

-All function  are local to the module
- angular.module do not compile until the library get loaded , to script k ander jo library load karte hai to ussko head me 
  ya body me module k pele liko

-  ng-init = it initializes data
<div ng-app="my app" ng-init="dob='09/10/1995'">
{{dob}}
</div>

AngularJS Data Binding:---

Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.
The data model is a collection of data available for the application.

AngularJS Scope(object which has data type and function):-

The scope is an js object with the available properties and methods.
The scope is available for both the view and the controller.
The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).

Angular scope
$scope is an object.
 how to use $scope ?

obj.name="chetus"; , similarly
$scope.name="chetus";

example:

<h1> {{name}} </h1>
<script>
$scope.name='chetus';
</script>

MVC in angular:===================
View, which is the HTML.
Model, which is the data available for the current view., ($scope)
Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.

Understanding the $Scope
the scope is the Model(ka ek type).
The scope is a JavaScript object with properties and methods, which are available for both the view and the controller.

-If you make changes in the view, the model and the controller will be updated:(form k input me value dalne par page par 
disply hoti hai ye mtlb hai)

Each repeation has its own Scope:=====

<div ng-app="myApp" mg-Controller="myCtrl">

<ol>
	<li>
		<p ng-repeat>{{ceo}}</p>
        </li>
</ol>

</div>

<script>
var abc = angular.module('myApp',[]);
abc.controller('myCtrl',function($scope){
$scope.name=['steve job','bill gate','mark'];
};)
</script>

When dealing with the ng-repeat directive, each repetition has access to the current repetition object:
Each <li> element has access to the current repetition object, in this case a string, which is referred to by using x.

Root Scope:-----

All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.
The rootScope is available in the entire application.
If a variable has the same name in both the current scope and in the rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope.

1. ng-app has its own created scope which is common for all called root scope
2. $rootScope is available in entire application
3. if $rootScope and $scope value are same then compiler select current scope

<body ng-app="myApp">
{{ceo}}

<div ng-controller="myCtrl" >
{{ceo}}
</div>
</body>

<script>
var abc = angular.module('myApp',[]);

abc.controller('myCtrl',function($scope){
$scope.ceo="mark";
});

abc.run('myApp',function($rootScope){
$rootScope="steve";
});
</script>

Angularjs Filter:==============

why filter - to transform data / sort from array

there are different types of filter present

-customize filter
-**filter
currency -Format a number to a currency format.
date -Format a date to a specified format.
filter- Select a subset of items from an array.
json -Format an object to a JSON string.
limitTo -Limits an array/string, into a specified number of elements/characters.
lowercase- Format a string to lower case.
number -Format a number to a string.
orderBy -Orders an array by an expression.
uppercase -Format a string to upper case.

1. Adding Filters to Expressions:===
Filters can be added to expressions by using the pipe character |, followed by a filter.

ex-:

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
<p>{{Empire | upperCase }}</p>
</div>

<script>
angular.module('myApp',[]).controller('myCtrl',function($scope){
$scope.Empire="Amazon";
});
</script>

2. Adding Filters to Directives:-
Filters are added to directives, like ng-repeat, by using the pipe character |

ex-:

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl" ">
<ol>
	<li ng-repeat="x in courage | orderBy:'para' " >
		{{x.id + ', ' + x.para}}
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<script>
angular.module('myApp',[]).controller('myCtrl',function($scope){
$scope.courage=[{id=1,para='speaking eye to eye'},{id=2,para='take stand'},{id=3,para='Fight for what you what'}];
});

</script>

2. currency 
<h1>Price: {{ price | currency }}</h1>

$scope.price=100;

o/p = $58

3. 'Filter' filter :-

The filter filter selects a subset of an array.
The filter filter can only be used on arrays, and it returns an array containing only the matching items.

<ol>
  <li ng-repeat="x in Consistency | filter :'a' ">
	{{Consistensy}}
  </li>
</ol>

$scope.Consistency=['at work','at caring', 'at worship','at goal'];

3. My fav(google search jesa kuch)

Filter an Array Based on User Input:
- in an input field just put ng-model then list will grow and search accoding to value inserted in the field

<input ng-model="take this val in input and search" />

<ol>
<li ng-repeat="x in Food | orderBy:take this val in input and search ">
{{Food}}
<li>
</ol>

4. table k column par click karne par change
<tr>
	<ti ng-click="myfunction('hardwork)"></ti>
	<ti ng-click="myfunction('successPercentage')"></ti>
</tr>
<tr ng-repeat="x in Scope | filter :mySort">
	<ti>{{x.hardwork}}</ti>
	<ti>{{x.successPercentage}}</ti>
</tr>	

$scope.Scope =[etc etc];
$scope.myFunction= function(x){
	$scope.mySort =x;
}

5. Custom Filters:------

	<p> {{name | myFilterOfUpperCase}}</p>

abc.filter('myFilterOfUpperCase',function(){
return function(x){

}
return ;
});
AngularJS Services:-

what are services ?
-function or object available to use, limited to angularjs Application
-AngularJS has about 30 built-in services

example1:

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl" >
{{myUrl}}
</div>

<script>
angular.module('myApp',[]).Controller('myCtrl',function($scope,$location){
 
$scope.myUrl= $location.absUrl();
});
</script>

Why to use Services ?(organize and share code)
AngularJS services are substitutable objects that are wired together using dependency injection (DI).
You can use services to organize and share code across your app. AngularJS services are: Lazily instantiated – AngularJS only 
instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.These are also called as singletons, which are the objects 
that are instantiated only once per application

-To share data between controllers, Services will fetch data from the database, if we store the data inside a controller, 
 once we change to another controller the data will be discarded.This problem can be solved by using $rootscope but, that is not
 the best way. If we keep the data inside service, that will be accessible for all the controllers.
-It provides a method to keep data across the lifetime of the angular application.
-It is used to organize and share data and functions across the application.
-We can divide our application into multiple different types of components which Angularjs can inject into each other.
 Modularizing our application makes it easier to reuse, configure and test the components in our application.

Custom Services in Angularjs:

We can define our own services in Angularjs.There are several ways to create custom services.
1)By using service() method
2)By using factory() method
3)By using provider() method
4)By using value() method
5)By using constant() method

But service() and factory() methods are most commonly used to create custom services.

1)service method:-
service() method uses the function constructor and it returns the object or a instance of the function to work with.
syntax:

module.service(‘service_name’, function() {
this.method1 = function(){
//…
}
This.method2 = function() {
//….
}
…
});

2)Factory method:-

factory() is a method on a module which takes name of the factory and the function as a arguments and this method uses 
the returned value of the function. It returns the value of the function returned after the execution.It is defined as follows:

module.factory(‘factory_name’, function() {
var factory = {};
factory.method = function () {
//……..
}
//……
return factory;
});

Service vs Factory
-Service return object
-Factory return value
-The difference between factory and service is just like the difference between a function and an object

$http service:--------
- agar server se kuch bhi utana ho to $http service ka use karege
-$http is an AngularJS service for reading data from remote servers.

example:
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl" >
{{myMsgSavedOnAnotherServer}}
</div>

<script>
var abc = angular.module('myApp',[]);
abc.controller('myCtrl',function($http,$scope){
$http.get(myMsg.htm).then(function(response){
	$scope.myMsgSavedOnAnotherServer=response.data;		
});
});
</script>

AngularJS $http

The AngularJS $http service makes a request to the server, and returns a response.
- means server se kuch utane ki request and return me response

Shortcut Method of $http service
$delete
$get
$post
$put
$patch
$head
$jsonp

How to use properties of response ?
.config  = used to generate header request
.data    = consist of data 
.status  =  consist of response status in number
.statusText = a string defining the HTTP status.

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl" >
{{content}}
{{numberOfStatus}}
{{StatusText}}
</div>

<script>
angular.module('myApp',[]).controller('myCtrl',function($scope,$http){

$http({
method:"GET" ,
url :"jsonData.php" // case sensitive
}).then
or
$http.get('jsonData.php').then(function(response){
$scope.content=response.data;
$scope.numberOfStatus=response.status;
$scope.statusText=response.statusText;
},function(response){
$scope.content ="something went wrong";
});
});

</script>

Q.   On server we have a file kept in json formate named records how will you fetch them ?
ans->
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl" >
<table >
 <th>
   <td>Name</td>
   <td>City</td>
   <td>Country</td>
 </th>
 <tr  ng-repeat="x in myData">
  <td >{{x.Name}}</td>
  <td >{{x.City}}</td>
  <td >{{x.Country}}</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $http) {
  $http.get("customers.php").then(function (response) {
      $scope.myData = response.data.records;
  });
});
</script>

note:-
Q. can we have multiple module in single app ?
ans- Yes , but give dependency also
ex-
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', [])
var myApp2 = angular.module('myApp2', ['myApp'])

$timeOut Service:==========

<p>{{message}}</p>

<script>
angular.module('myApp',[]).controller('myCtrl',function($scope,$timeout){
$scope.message="dream"; 

$timeout(function(){
$scope.message="Fight"; 
},1000);
$timeout(function(){
$scope.message="Success"; 
},2000);


});
</script>

$interval Service:-----
- If any entity value is changing per unit of time(either secound or minute) then it must be placed inside $interval service.

Time Example of service:
 <p>{{myClock}}</p>
 
<script>
var abc = angular.module('myApp',[]).controller('myCtrl',function($scope,$interval){
  $interval(function(){
$scope.myClock= new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
},1000);
});

</script>
